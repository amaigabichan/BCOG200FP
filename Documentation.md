The project aims to implement two servers for text communication using Python. These servers will communicate with each other through TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and encrypt their messages using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption algorithm. This will ensure secure communication between the servers, maintaining confidentiality of the transmitted data. Additionally, a graphical user interface (GUI) will be provided for user interaction to have a more user friendly feel.



This is the completed functionality from the proposed project in command line, as other than the GUI, end-to-end encryption and communication has been achieved. As messages could not display without having a working TCP connection, it is evident that that portion works. Additionally, as an encryption decryption scheme, such as AES, needs both ends to properly decrypt and encrypt to have comprehensible text, that portion also works.

I must still complete the GUI. I want to add functionality to change keys and initialization vectors through a handshake process to add additional security which may cause difficulties in the future. Additionally, I want to be able to send files possibly.
