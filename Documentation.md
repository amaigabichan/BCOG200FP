The project aims to implement two servers for text communication using Python. These servers will communicate with each other through TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and encrypt their messages using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption algorithm. This will ensure secure communication between the servers, maintaining confidentiality of the transmitted data. Additionally, a graphical user interface (GUI) was provided for user interaction to have a more user friendly feel.

This is the completed functionality from the proposed project in command line and end-to-end encryption and communication has been achieved. As messages could not display without having a working TCP connection, it is evident that that portion works. Additionally, as an encryption decryption scheme, such as AES, needs both ends to properly decrypt and encrypt to have comprehensible text, that portion also works.

Port Inclusion: Added a port variable to specify the listening port for the client. This allows the client to listen for incoming messages on a specific port. This change enhances the functionality of the project by enabling communication through a defined port, ensuring that messages are received on the correct channel. It aligns with the project's aim of implementing secure communication between the servers while maintaining confidentiality of the transmitted data.

Server1 Removal: Since you're now using a client-to-client communication model, there's no need for a dedicated server (Server1). Each client acts as both a sender and receiver. This simplifies the architecture of the system, making it more efficient and suitable for peer-to-peer communication, which aligns with the project's objective of implementing a peer-to-peer messaging platform. Removal of Server1 also eliminates potential single points of failure, enhancing the robustness of the system.
